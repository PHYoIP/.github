## PHYoIP

Physical interfaces over TCP/IP.

"PHY" might be misunderstood for _Ethernet PHY_, but it actually describes any interface in the lower OSI layers (see [osi-model.com/physical-layer](https://osi-model.com/physical-layer/)). So this project mainly targets embedded (or other LL) developers.
For example it may help you on monitoring long term measurements/tests in a remote lab (e.g. climate chambers, or basements). Or simply allow for multiple loggers/monitors listen on the same device.

PHYoIP defines several higher level [protocols](https://github.com/PHYoIP/protocol) and provides reference/example implementations of servers and clients.
